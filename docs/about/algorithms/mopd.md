# Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD)

Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) distills one or more teacher models
into the policy by replacing GRPO's reward-based advantage with a token-level
distillation advantage ([MiMo-V2-Flash Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02780)).
MOPD runs on async GRPO and collects rollouts through NeMo Gym, so the agent
loop drives multi-turn / multi-step interaction. Each token of the resulting
student rollout is scored by a teacher, and the policy is updated to close the
gap with the teacher.

Unlike the teacher-logit knowledge distillation in
[On-policy Distillation](on-policy-distillation.md) (`run_distillation.py`), MOPD
runs on top of the GRPO trainer: it is selected with `adv_estimator: opd` and
serves teachers from dedicated, non-colocated worker groups during async
collection.

## Advantage

For each token `t`, the distillation advantage is the stop-gradient
teacher-minus-student log-probability gap:

```
Â_t = sg[ log π_teacher(t) − log π_student(t) ]
```

`log π_student` is the policy's `prev_logprobs` and `log π_teacher` is computed
by the teacher worker group at collection time. Maximizing this advantage is
reverse-KL minimization — it pushes the student toward the teacher's token
distribution — but, unlike forward-KL logit distillation, it needs only the
teacher's log-probability for the *sampled* token rather than the full
vocabulary distribution.

The advantage is applied only to trained (assistant) tokens via the loss mask;
tool / environment tokens contribute zero. Because the advantage subtracts a
real `prev_logprobs`, MOPD requires the student log-probabilities to actually be
computed — see [Configuration](#configuration).

## Configuration

Enable MOPD in two places: select the advantage estimator and add the
`on_policy_distillation` block.

```yaml
grpo:
  # MOPD runs on async GRPO with NeMo Gym rollouts.
  async_grpo:
    enabled: true
  adv_estimator:
    name: opd
  # OPD subtracts a real prev_logprobs, so it must not be skipped.
  seq_logprob_error_threshold: 2.0

loss_fn:
  # REINFORCE form (drop the PPO probability-ratio clipping); on-policy
  # correction is handled by the ICE-POP gate below instead.
  disable_ppo_ratio: true
  # ICE-POP hard gate: zero tokens whose train/inference importance-sampling
  # weight falls outside bounds, correcting async off-policy drift.
  use_importance_sampling_correction: true
  truncated_importance_sampling_type: icepop
  # Teacher distillation is the entire learning signal — no reference-policy KL.
  reference_policy_kl_penalty: 0.0

on_policy_distillation:
  enabled: true
  # Map each NeMo Gym agent name to a teacher checkpoint.
  teacher_model_by_agent_name:
    default_teacher: Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B
  # Agents not present in the map fall back to this alias (must be a mapped key).
  default_teacher_alias: default_teacher
  # If true, an unmapped agent raises instead of falling back.
  strict_agent_name_match: false
  # Aliases that share one checkpoint reuse a single teacher worker group.
  deduplicate_shared_teacher_checkpoints: true
  non_colocated_teachers:
    enabled: true
    # Resourcing for each teacher worker group.
    default_teacher_cfg:
      tensor_model_parallel_size: 2
      pipeline_model_parallel_size: 1
      context_parallel_size: 1
      num_nodes: 1
      gpus_per_node: 8
      precision: bf16
      micro_batch_size: 1
    # Optional per-alias overrides on top of default_teacher_cfg.
    teacher_overrides: {}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Teachers run the Megatron backend in inference-only mode. A DTensor-configured
> policy is rejected for the teacher; PEFT / draft modules are stripped so
> adapters are never attached to the frozen teacher; and teachers run
> unquantized (a policy `quant_cfg` is ignored, with a warning).

> [!NOTE]
> `adv_estimator: opd` fails fast at setup if the config would zero
> `prev_logprobs` (`loss_fn.force_on_policy_ratio: true` with no
> `grpo.seq_logprob_error_threshold`), because the advantage would silently
> degrade to `teacher_logprobs − 0`.

### Teacher routing

Each rollout sample carries its NeMo Gym `agent_ref`. At collection time the
agent name is resolved to a teacher alias (`teacher_model_by_agent_name`, falling
back to `default_teacher_alias`), samples are grouped by teacher, and each group
is scored by exactly one teacher — there is no ensemble averaging across
teachers. When several aliases map to the same checkpoint,
`deduplicate_shared_teacher_checkpoints` collapses them onto a single worker
group so they share GPUs.

### Resourcing

Non-colocated teachers each get their own Ray cluster on dedicated GPUs (they
are queried every rollout group, so time-sharing with the policy/generation
would serialize and destroy the async overlap). Their nodes are reserved from
the policy's budget: with `total_nodes` total, the teacher groups take
`sum(num_nodes)` and the policy uses the remainder (setup fails if nothing is
left for the policy). Deduplicated teachers share one group's nodes.

For example, the reference 3-node recipe lays out: 1 node policy (student,
trainable) + 1 node vLLM generation (frozen) + 1 node teacher (frozen). Ten
distinct teachers at 1 node each would instead add 10 nodes on top of the
policy and generation nodes.

## Running MOPD

MOPD collects rollouts through NeMo Gym, so use the NeMo Gym GRPO entrypoint
with an MOPD recipe. The checked-in recipe uses placeholder dataset paths;
override them for your local data:

```sh
uv run examples/nemo_gym/run_grpo_nemo_gym.py \
  --config examples/configs/recipes/llm/mopd-qwen3-1.7b-3n8g-megatron-pack.yaml \
  data.train.data_path=/path/to/train.jsonl \
  data.validation.data_path=/path/to/val.jsonl
```

The reference recipe self-distills `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` (student == teacher) across
3 nodes (1 policy + 1 vLLM + 1 teacher) with sequence packing enabled. Because
student and teacher are identical, the OPD loss stays near zero — it is a
correctness smoke test, not a demonstration of distillation gains.

## Monitoring

By default MOPD logs three batch-wide scalars: `on_policy_distillation/teacher_student_logprob_gap_mean`,
`adv_mean` and `adv_std`. In a multi-teacher run they are dominated by whichever teacher gets the most samples.
`detailed_metrics` (`nemo_rl/algorithms/opd_metrics.py`) adds per-teacher diagnostics every step:

```yaml
on_policy_distillation:
  detailed_metrics:
    enabled: true     # on_policy_distillation/<teacher>/* every step (a few seconds per step on 128k batches)
    per_agent: true   # plus on_policy_distillation/agent/<agent>/{n_samples,k1_tok,gen_len_mean,trunc_rate}
```

`<teacher>` is the first path component after the teachers' common root (e.g. `math`, `if-fc`), and `all` covers
the whole batch. With A_t = log π_T − log π_S on the sampled token:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `k1_tok`, `k1_seq`, `k3_tok` | Reverse KL(S‖T) estimates: k1 = −A (token mean, per-sequence mean), k3 = e^A − 1 − A |
| `abs_adv`, `adv_p01`, `adv_p99` | Advantage magnitude and tails |
| `frac_tok_small`, `frac_tok_neg`, `frac_tok_big` | Share of tokens with \|A\| < 0.01, A < −1, \|A\| > 5 |
| `student_nll`, `teacher_xent` | −mean log-prob of the generated tokens under vLLM (≈ student entropy) and under the teacher |
| `gen_len_mean`, `gen_len_p90`, `trunc_rate`, `n_samples`, `tok_share` | Response length and truncation over all samples, including overlong-filtered ones |
| `acc`, `k1_tok_correct`, `k1_tok_wrong` | Verifier accuracy (reward ≥ 0.5) and reverse KL split by it |
| `k1_tok_pos_<bucket>`, `abs_adv_pos_<bucket>` | The same by position in the response: 0-1k, 1k-4k, 4k-16k, 16k-64k, 64k+ tokens |

KL, advantage and entropy metrics use the loss tokens, so overlong-filtered samples are excluded from them. The same
keys can be recomputed offline from the `train_data_step*.jsonl` dumps with the same function.
